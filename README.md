## Hello there!

I'm an undergraduate senior at Reed College studying chemistry with a minor in English. I'm passionate about scientific literacy and truthful data visualization. In addition to wet and dry lab experience, I work extensively with R and RStudio in my studies and as a course assistant, with some experience in LaTeX via Overleaf. I have extensive higher education IT help desk support experience in both hands-on and remote settings.
